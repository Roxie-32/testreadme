# Roles in Rocket.Chat

Roles and permissions are integral to managing access in any digital workspace. Rocket.Chat employs a comprehensive role-based system for secure and efficient workspace management. This system allows administrators to assign roles, each with a specific set of [permissions](../use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/permissions/), to control user actions and access levels within the workspace.

## Categories of Rocket.Chat Roles

### Rocket.Chat Administrator Role

A Rocket.Chat administrator has the `Admin` role, which gives full access to the entire Rocket.Chat workspace. They can manage both [workspace-administration](../use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/ "mention") and [omnichannel](../use-rocket.chat/omnichannel/ "mention") settings.

### Rocket.Chat User Roles

Rocket.Chat users can have one or more roles, allowing them to perform the various actions granted by the Role's permissions.

### Rocket.Chat Marketplace Roles

Internally, we have two roles for [Rocket.Chat Marketplace](../extend-rocket.chat-capabilities/rocket.chat-marketplace/); one within the publisher and the second within the system. Henceforth, they're known as publisher roles and system roles.

#### Publisher Roles

There are three different roles within a Publisher, which include the following:

* [Owner](roles-in-rocket.chat.md#publisher-owner)
* [Developer](roles-in-rocket.chat.md#publisher-developer)
* [Viewer](roles-in-rocket.chat.md#publisher-viewer)

The Owner role is applied whenever someone creates a publisher. Each of the subsequent roles only applies to people they have invited.

#### Publisher: Owner

The `owner` has permission to manage everything on the publisher dashboard. It includes managing both Apps and other Users.

To change the role of another user,

* Click **Change Role** from the **Actions** dropdown across the user in question
* Select the desired Role to change

#### Publisher: Developer

A user with the `developer` role can read everything and update Apps.

#### Publisher: Viewer

The `viewer` role can read everything but can.t update anything.

{% hint style="info" %}
See [#scope-of-roles](../use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/permissions/#scope-of-roles "mention") to learn more about the role scopes in Rocket.Chat.
{% endhint %}

Rocket.Chat's role-based system provides a robust and flexible mechanism for managing access to resources and features within a workspace. By offering a variety of predefined roles and the ability to create custom roles, Rocket.Chat ensures that workspace administrators can effectively control and limit user actions.
