{% endhint %}

Keeping your Rocket.Chat installation up-to-date is essential to access the latest features, bug fixes, and security enhancements. This technical guide will walk you through the process of updating Rocket.Chat across various deployment methods. Workspace admins should monitor new releases and [release notes](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/releases) to determine whether updates should be applied to their Rocket.Chat workspace.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
* For a successful update, you must not skip any major version. That is, say you want to move from version `1.x.x` to say `4.x.x`, you need to traverse chronologically `1.x.x` -> `2.x.x` -> `3.x.x` -> `4.x.x`. Ideally, it's even better to make more granular steps, and not skip more than two minor versions at a time.
* Upgrading to `v5` requires you to be on at least `4.x`.
