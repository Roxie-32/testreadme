# Rocket.Chat

Every day, we rely on communication platforms for collaboration with colleagues, businesses, customers, and communities. However, most platforms offer limited control and customization. Rocket.Chat stands apart as a secure, compliant collaboration platform. With Rocket.Chat, you truly own your data, enjoy limitless customization, and benefit from seamless integration capabilities. Take control of your communication with [Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat).

Rocket.Chat, a secure and customizable open-source platform, is designed for organizations with stringent data protection standards. It seamlessly integrates real-time conversations across web, desktop, and mobile devices, connecting colleagues, businesses, and customers. With its ability to integrate multiple channels such as Live Chat, email, and social media, it provides a unified customer view, enhancing efficiency. Our mobile app, available for Android and iOS, further empowers you to engage in conversations, respond to messages, and collaborate effectively. Choose the deployment method that suits you best: self-hosted on your server or via our SaaS offering. For our [enterprise plan](setup-and-configure/enterprise-edition-trial/), we offer dedicated support and professional services.
